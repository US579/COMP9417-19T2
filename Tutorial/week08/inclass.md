### how to learn a classifier if the data is non-linerability separable?

1. Grident descent 
2. trying to fit with nonliner algorithem 
3. transform the data into another space




# ensamble learning 
1. boosting 
- weak 
   - error < 0.5 close to 0.5
- strong 
   - error < 0.5 close to 0

  dataset D , A set of hypothesis

2. random forest

3.
